# yomato-frontend
This repository contains the code for **[Yomato](https://yomato.in)**'s frontend - find out what you can order and eat from Zomato based on how much you have on **[Yomato](https://yomato.in)**.

# Running Locally
Clone this repository to your local machine, and then install dependencies by running:
```bash
yarn install
```

After that, you may spin up the frontend by running:
```bash
yarn start
```

In order for API calls to work properly, you may clone and run [yomato-backend](https://github.com/diragb/yomato-backend) on the side. This would require you to update the `.env` file at the root of this project with contents from the `.example.env` file.
